<span>每个女性朋友圈里都有一个搞笑的人</span>
<code>the one you go to when you need a good cry,</code>
<span>当你需要大哭一场时你可以去找她</span>
<code>the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day.</code>
<span>当你遭遇不顺时她会告诉你忍忍就过了</span>
<code>And this group was no different.</code>
<span>而以下这个朋友圈也一样</span>
<code>Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women</code>
<span>除了这是一群卓越的女子</span>
<code>who came together --</code>
<span>她们聚在一起——</span>
<code>first to become teammates, then friends, and then family --</code>
<span>先成为队友，然后朋友，最后家人——</span>
<code>in the least likely of places:</code>
<span>在最不可能发生这一切的地方：</span>
<code>on the Special Operations battlefield.</code>
<span>在特种部队的战场上</span>
<code>This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented</code>
<span>这群女子她们友谊和英勇的凝结</span>
<code>not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear,</code>
<span>不单是靠她们在枪林弹雨中奋斗来的</span>
<code>but by the fact that they were there</code>
<span>还因为这么一个事实</span>
<code>at a time when women -- officially, at least --</code>
<span>事实就是那时候女人</span>
<code>remained banned from ground combat,</code>
<span>在官方上是不能参加地面作战的</span>
<code>and America had no idea they existed.</code>
<span>美国对她们的存在并不知情</span>
<code>This story begins with Special Operations leaders,</code>
<span>故事是从特种部队的队长开始的</span>
<code>some of the most tested men in the United States military, saying,</code>
<span>一些经受过考验的美国男士兵说</span>
<code>"We need women to help us wage this war."</code>
<span>“我们需要女人来帮我们发动战争。”</span>
<code>"America would never kill its way to the end of its wars," it argued.</code>
<span>“美国绝不会让战争结束的。”是这样说的</span>
<code>"Needed more knowledge and more understanding."</code>
<span>“需要更多的认识和理解。”</span>
<code>And as everyone knows,</code>
<span>每个人都知道</span>
<code>if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home,</code>
<span>如果你想知道一个社区或一个家庭里发生了什么</span>
<code>you talk to women,</code>
<span>你得找女人聊天</span>
<code>whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan,</code>
<span>不管你是聊阿富汗南部</span>
<code>or Southern California.</code>
<span>还是加州南部</span>
<code>But in this case, men could not talk to women,</code>
<span>但在这种情况下， 男人不能和女人聊天</span>
<code>because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan,</code>
<span>因为在一个保守的传统的社会，像阿富汗</span>
<code>that would cause grave offense.</code>
<span>会被视为大不敬</span>
<code>So you needed women soldiers out there.</code>
<span>所以你需要女兵到那里去</span>
<code>That meant, at this time in the war, that the women who would be recruited</code>
<span>也就是说，在此时的战争中， 那些被陆军游骑兵</span>
<code>to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs,</code>
<span>和海军海豹突击队招募去的女士们</span>
<code>would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent</code>
<span>会看到不到百分之五的美国士兵</span>
<code>of the entire United States military.</code>
<span>所经历的那种战斗</span>
<code>Less than five percent.</code>
<span>不到百分之五</span>
<code>So the call went out.</code>
<span>所以有这样的口号：</span>
<code>"Female soldiers: Become a part of history.</code>
<span>“女兵们：改变历史</span>
<code>Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan."</code>
<span>加入特种部队在阿富汗的战场吧。”</span>
