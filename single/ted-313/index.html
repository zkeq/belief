<span>我想了很久该用什么词作为今天的开场白，</span>
<code>and I decided to say "Colombia."</code>
<span>我决定来谈谈“哥伦比亚”。</span>
<code>And the reason, I don't know how many of you have visited Colombia,</code>
<span>至于原因嘛，我不知道你们中有多少人去过哥伦比亚，</span>
<code>but Colombia is just north of the border with Brazil.</code>
<span>哥伦比亚与巴西北部接壤，</span>
<code>It's a beautiful country</code>
<span>是个非常美丽的国家。</span>
<code>with extraordinary people, like me and others -- (Laughter) --</code>
<span>那里生活着非凡的人民，像我还有其他人一样，（笑声）</span>
<code>and it's populated with incredible fauna, flora.</code>
<span>那里遍布着各种珍奇的动物和植被。</span>
<code>It's got water; it's got everything to be the perfect place.</code>
<span>那里有丰富的水资源，那里拥有成为完美之地的所有条件。</span>
<code>But we have a few problems.</code>
<span>但也存在一些问题。</span>
<code>You may have heard of some of them.</code>
<span>你也许听说过其中一些。</span>
<code>We have the oldest standing guerrilla in the world.</code>
<span>我们有着世界上历史最悠久的游击队，</span>
<code>It's been around for over 50 years,</code>
<span>持续活跃已超过50年，</span>
<code>which means that in my lifetime,</code>
<span>这意味着在我迄今为止的人生中，</span>
<code>I have never lived one day  of peace in my country.</code>
<span>这个国家从未享受过一天的和平。</span>
<code>This guerrilla -- and the main group is the FARC guerrillas,</code>
<span>这支游击队主体上隶属于FARC，</span>
<code>Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --</code>
<span>即“哥伦比亚革命武装军”，</span>
<code>they have financed their war by kidnapping, by extortion,</code>
<span>他们通过绑架和敲诈勒索来筹募战争经费，</span>
<code>by getting into the drug trade, by illegal mining.</code>
<span>毒品交易和非法采矿也是他们牟利的手段。</span>
<code>There has been terrorism. There have been random bombs.</code>
<span>恐怖主义和随处爆炸的炸弹也存在于日常生活当中。</span>
<code>So it's not good. It's not really good.</code>
<span>情况不容乐观，其实非常糟糕。</span>
<code>And if you look at the human cost of this war over 50 years,</code>
<span>让我们来看看在过去50年来战争的人道成本，</span>
<code>we have had more than 5.7 million displaced population.</code>
<span>超过570万人流离失所，</span>
<code>It's one of the biggest displaced populations in the world,</code>
<span>这是世界上规模最大的流离人口数字之一。</span>
<code>and this conflict has cost over 220,000 lives.</code>
<span>武装冲突还让22万人失去了生命，</span>
<code>So it's a little bit like the Bolívar wars again.</code>
<span>像又一次经历了玻利瓦尔革命战争，</span>
<code>It's a lot of people who have died unnecessarily.</code>
<span>造成了大量不必要的死亡。</span>
<code>We are now in the middle of peace talks,</code>
<span>目前我们正处于和平谈判的进程中，</span>
<code>and we've been trying to help resolve this problem peacefully,</code>
<span>我们一直竭力于和平地解决存在的问题，</span>
<code>and as part of that,</code>
<span>作为努力的一部分，</span>
<code>we decided to try something completely lateral and different:</code>
<span>我们决定从侧面尝试一些完全不同的策略：</span>
<code>Christmas lights.</code>
<span>圣诞灯饰。</span>
<code>So Christmas lights, and you're saying,</code>
<span>圣诞灯饰啊，你心里一定在嘀咕，</span>
<code>what the hell is this guy going to talk about?</code>
<span>这家伙到底要说什么？</span>
<code>I am going to talk about gigantic trees</code>
<span>我要说的是，</span>
<code>that we put in nine strategic  pathways in the jungle</code>
<span>我们种在丛林中九条战略要道上的参天大树，</span>
<code>covered with Christmas lights.</code>
<span>上面挂满了圣诞灯饰。</span>
<code>These trees helped us  demobilize 331 guerrillas,</code>
<span>这些大树帮我们遣散了331名游击队员，</span>
<code>roughly five percent of the guerrilla force at the time.</code>
<span>大约占当时游击队员人数的5%。</span>
<code>These trees were lit up at night,</code>
<span>这些树在夜晚被点亮，</span>
<code>and they had a sign beside them</code>
<span>旁边还有一个标语牌，</span>
<code>that said, "If Christmas can come to the jungle, you can come home.</code>
<span>上面写着：“如果圣诞降临丛林，你就能够回家。</span>
<code>Demobilize.</code>
<span>退出吧，</span>
<code>At Christmas, everything is possible."</code>
<span>在圣诞节，一切皆有可能。”</span>
<code>So how do we know these trees worked?</code>
<span>我们怎么知道这些树起了作用呢？</span>
<code>Well, we got 331, which is okay,</code>
<span>现在我们有331人的成果，其实还不错，</span>
<code>but we also know that not a lot of guerrillas saw them,</code>
<span>但我们也知道，并没有太多的游击队员见过这些树，</span>
<code>but we know that a lot of guerrillas heard about them,</code>
<span>我们还知道，即便如此，还是有很多游击队员听说过这些树。</span>
<code>and we know this</code>
<span>我们能够得知这些，</span>
<code>because we are constantly talking to demobilized guerrillas.</code>
<span>是因为我们在不断地与退伍的游击队员对话。</span>
<code>So let me take you back four years before the trees.</code>
<span>让我带你们回到开始弄这些树的四年之前。</span>
<code>Four years before the trees, we were approached by the government</code>
<span>在这些树出现的四年前，政府联系到了我们，</span>
<code>to help them come up with a communications strategy</code>
<span>让我们帮忙设立一个沟通战略，</span>
<code>to get as many guerrillas as we could out of the jungle.</code>
<span>让尽可能多更多的游击队员离开丛林。</span>
<code>The government had a military strategy,</code>
<span>政府有相应的军事战略、</span>
<code>it had a legal strategy,</code>
<span>法律战略、</span>
<code>it had a political strategy, but it said,</code>
<span>还有政治战略，但他们说</span>
<code>"We don't really have a communications strategy,</code>
<span>“我们没有什么沟通战略，</span>
<code>and it probably would be a good thing to have,"</code>
<span>拥有沟通战略可能还不赖。”</span>
<code>so we decided to immediately jump into this,</code>
<span>所以我们决定马上投入这件事，</span>
<code>because it is an opportunity to affect the outcome of the conflict</code>
<span>因为这是一次机会，去主动影响武装冲突的结果，</span>
<code>with the things that we do, with the tools that we have.</code>
<span>运用我们所从事的工作，以及我们所拥有的工具。</span>
<code>But we didn't know very much about it.</code>
<span>而我们对情况的了解的并不是很多。</span>
<code>We didn't understand in Colombia,  if you live in the cities,</code>
<span>在哥伦比亚，如果你住在城市里，</span>
<code>you're very far away from where  the war is actually happening,</code>
<span>你其实距离战争真正发生的地方很远，</span>
<code>so you don't really understand it,</code>
<span>所以你并不会理解个中机要。</span>
<code>and we asked the government  to give us access</code>
<span>我们向政府要求权限，</span>
<code>to as many demobilized guerrillas as possible.</code>
<span>能够尽可能地接触到那些退伍的游击队员。</span>
<code>And we talked to about 60 of them</code>
<span>我们差不多与60人交谈过，</span>
<code>before we felt we fully understood the problem.</code>
<span>才感觉完全理解了这个问题。</span>
<code>We talked about -- they told us why  they had joined the guerrillas,</code>
<span>我们谈到了他们加入游击队的缘由，</span>
<code>why the left the guerrillas, what their dreams were,</code>
<span>离开游击队的原因，以及他们的梦想是什么，</span>
<code>what their frustrations were,</code>
<span>他们遇到了哪些挫折，</span>
<code>and from those conversations came the underlying insight</code>
<span>从这些对谈中洞察到的深层次结论，</span>
<code>that has guided this whole campaign,</code>
<span>引领了整个运动。</span>
<code>which is that guerrillas are as much prisoners of their organizations</code>
<span>这个结论就是：游击队员就是他们自己组织中的囚徒，</span>
<code>as the people they hold hostage.</code>
<span>与那些他们绑架的人质并无两样。</span>
<code>And at the beginning, we were so touched by these stories,</code>
<span>听到这些故事，我们一开始觉得很受触动、</span>
<code>we were so amazed by these stories,</code>
<span>很吃惊，</span>
<code>that we thought that maybe  the best way to talk to the guerrillas</code>
<span>我们就想，也许跟游击队员最好的沟通方式就是</span>
<code>was to have them talk to themselves,</code>
<span>让他们自己人之间进行对话，</span>
<code>so we recorded about a hundred different stories during the first year,</code>
<span>所以在第一年里，我们录下了上百个不同的故事，</span>
<code>and we put them on the radio and television</code>
<span>在广播和电视上播出，</span>
<code>so that the guerrillas in the jungle could hear stories, their stories,</code>
<span>这样，丛林中的游击队员就能听到这些故事，他们的故事，</span>
<code>or stories similar to theirs,</code>
<span>或是和他们息息相关的故事，</span>
<code>and when they heard them, they decided to go out.</code>
<span>当他们听到这些故事，会决定退出。</span>
<code>I want to tell you one of these stories.</code>
<span>我给你们讲一个例子。</span>
<code>This person you see here  is Giovanni Andres.</code>
<span>你看到的这个人是吉奥瓦尼•安德烈斯，</span>
<code>Giovanni Andres is 25 when we took that picture.</code>
<span>照这张照片时，他25岁。</span>
<code>He had been seven years in the guerrilla, and he had demobilized very recently.</code>
<span>他曾经当了七年的游击队员，最近刚刚退出。</span>
<code>His story is the following:</code>
<span>他的故事是这样的：</span>
<code>He was recruited when he was 17,</code>
<span>他在17岁时应招进入游击队，</span>
<code>and sometime later, in his squadron, if you will,</code>
<span>过了一阵子，他的“连队”里</span>
<code>this beautiful girl was recruited, and they fell in love.</code>
<span>来了一位美丽的女孩，他们相爱了。</span>
<code>Their conversations were about what their family was going to be like,</code>
<span>他们谈到自己的小家庭会是什么样子，</span>
<code>what their kids' names would be,</code>
<span>他们的孩子会叫什么名字，</span>
<code>how their life would be when they left the guerrilla.</code>
<span>他们离开游击队后会过上什么样的生活。</span>
<code>But it turns out</code>
<span>然而，</span>
<code>that love is very strictly forbidden in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,</code>
<span>低级别的游击队员是严禁恋爱的，</span>
<code>so their romance was discovered and they were separated.</code>
<span>他们的恋情被发现后，俩人就被分开了。</span>
<code>He was sent very far away, and she was left behind.</code>
<span>他被遣送到很远的地方，而她则被留了下来。</span>
<code>She was very familiar with the territory,</code>
<span>她十分熟悉当地的地形，</span>
<code>so one night, when she was on guard,</code>
<span>所以在她负责守夜的某个晚上，</span>
<code>she just left,</code>
<span>她逃脱了，</span>
<code>and she went to the army, she demobilized,</code>
<span>到军队投诚。</span>
<code>and she was one of the persons that we had the fortune to talk to,</code>
<span>我们有幸与她对话，</span>
<code>and we were really touched by this story,</code>
<span>因她的故事而深受感动，</span>
<code>so we made a radio spot,</code>
<span>我们为之做了一个广播节目，</span>
<code>and it turns out, by chance,</code>
<span>但我们未曾想到，</span>
<code>that far away, many,  many kilometers north,</code>
<span>在很多公里以北的远方，</span>
<code>he heard her on the radio,</code>
<span>这个节目被他听到了。</span>
<code>and when he heard her on the radio, he said, "What am I doing here?</code>
<span>当他听到广播中她的声音时，他对自己说：“我究竟在干嘛？</span>
<code>She had the balls to get out. I need to do the same thing."</code>
<span>她有那样的勇气脱离困境，我也要做同样的事。</span>
<code>And he did.</code>
<span>于是他也逃了。</span>
<code>He walked for two days and two nights,</code>
<span>他整整走了两天两夜，</span>
<code>and he risked his life and he got out,</code>
<span>冒着生命危险终于逃脱了，</span>
<code>and the only thing he wanted was to see her.</code>
<span>只是想要去见她，</span>
<code>The only thing that was in his mind was to see her.</code>
<span>这是他唯一的念头。</span>
<code>The story was, they did meet.</code>
<span>故事的结局是，他们见面了。</span>
<code>I know you're wondering if they did meet.</code>
<span>我知道你们想问他们有没有重聚，</span>
<code>They did meet.</code>
<span>他们确实见到彼此了。</span>
<code>She had been recruited when she was 15, and she left when she was 17,</code>
<span>她进游击队的时候15岁，逃脱的时候17岁，</span>
<code>so there were a lot of other complications,</code>
<span>可以想见其中艰辛曲折，</span>
<code>but they did eventually meet.</code>
<span>但他们最终还是见到了彼此。</span>
<code>I don't know if they're together now, but I can find out. (Laughter)</code>
<span>我不知道他们现在是不是还在一起，不过可以回去查查。（笑声）</span>
<code>But what I can tell you is that our radio strategy was working.</code>
<span>但我能告诉你们，我们的广播策略确实起效了。</span>
<code>The problem is that it was working in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.</code>
<span>不过问题在于，这个策略只在级别较低的游击队员中起效，</span>
<code>It was not working with the commanders,</code>
<span>对于指挥官就没什么效果，</span>
<code>the people that are more difficult to replace,</code>
<span>他们是更难被替代的人。</span>
<code>because you can easily recruit but you can't get the older commanders.</code>
<span>因为招募队员容易，而指挥官只能内部培养。</span>
<code>So we thought, well, we'll use the same strategy.</code>
<span>所以我们想，好吧，可以用同样的策略，</span>
<code>We'll have commanders talking to commanders.</code>
<span>让指挥官与指挥官对话。</span>
<code>And we even went as far as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla</code>
<span>我们甚至让从前是游击队指挥官的人，</span>
<code>to fly on helicopters with microphones</code>
<span>坐上直升机，用麦克风喊话，</span>
<code>telling the people that used to fight with them,</code>
<span>告诉那些曾经和他们并肩作战的人们，</span>
<code>"There is a better life out there,"</code>
<span>”外面的生活更美好，“</span>
<code>"I'm doing good," "This is not worth it," etc.</code>
<span>”我现在过得很好，” “这不值得“ 等等。</span>
<code>But, as you can all imagine, it was very easy to counteract,</code>
<span>不过，你们都能想象到，这个方法不太奏效。</span>
<code>because what was the guerrilla going to say?</code>
<span>游击队可以说：</span>
<code>"Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that, he's going to get killed."</code>
<span>“对呀，如果他不照做，可能会被（政府军）杀掉。”</span>
<code>So it was easy, so we were suddenly left with nothing,</code>
<span>这样狡辩的确很容易，很快我们就只能无功而返，</span>
<code>because the guerrilla were spreading the word</code>
<span>因为游击队开始到处宣传说</span>
<code>that all of those things are done</code>
<span>所有这些招安的说辞</span>
<code>because if they don't do it,  they're in danger.</code>
<span>都是被迫的，说话的人正处于危险之中。</span>
<code>And somebody, some brilliant person in our team,</code>
<span>我们团队里有个天才</span>
<code>came back and said, "You know what I noticed?</code>
<span>回来之后说：“知道我看出什么了吗？</span>
<code>I noticed that around Christmastime,</code>
<span>我发现圣诞节期间</span>
<code>there have been peaks of demobilization</code>
<span>正是他们退出游击队的高潮，</span>
<code>since this war has started."</code>
<span>从这场战争开始的时候就一直如此。”</span>
<code>And that was incredible,</code>
<span>这真是不可思议，</span>
<code>because that led us to think  that we needed to talk to the human being</code>
<span>这让我们认识到对话的另一方是“人”，</span>
<code>and not to the soldier.</code>
<span>而非“士兵”。</span>
<code>We needed to step away from talking</code>
<span>我们要避免</span>
<code>from government to army, from army to army,</code>
<span>政府对军队、或是军队对军队这些形式的对话，</span>
<code>and we needed to talk about the universal values,</code>
<span>我们要说的是普世价值，</span>
<code>and we needed to talk about humanity.</code>
<span>我们要说的是人性。</span>
<code>And that was when the Christmas tree happened.</code>
<span>圣诞树的点子就这样应运而生。</span>
<code>This picture that I have here,</code>
<span>这张照片上</span>
<code>you see this is the planning of the Christmas trees,</code>
<span>展示的是圣诞树的规划阶段，</span>
<code>and that man you see there with the three stars,</code>
<span>这个戴着三颗星的男人</span>
<code>he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.</code>
<span>是胡安•马纽埃尔•瓦尔迪兹上尉。</span>
<code>Captain Valdez was the first  high-ranking official</code>
<span>瓦尔迪兹上尉是第一个</span>
<code>to give us the helicopters  and the support we needed</code>
<span>为我们提供直升机和其他支持的高级军官，</span>
<code>to put these Christmas trees up,</code>
<span>立起了这些圣诞树。</span>
<code>and he said in that meeting something that I will never forget.</code>
<span>他在这次会议上说的话，我永远不会忘记。</span>
<code>He said, "I want to do this because being generous makes me stronger,</code>
<span>他说：“我之所以要这样做，是因为慷慨让我更强，</span>
<code>makes my men feel stronger."</code>
<span>让我的队伍更强。”</span>
<code>And I get very emotional when I remember him</code>
<span>每当我想起他都很感慨，</span>
<code>because he was killed later in combat and we really miss him,</code>
<span>因为他在后来的一次战斗中牺牲了，我们真的很想念他，</span>
<code>but I wanted you all to see him, because he was really, really important.</code>
<span>但我想让你们都看看，他是多么的重要。</span>
<code>He gave us all the support to put up the first Christmas trees.</code>
<span>第一批圣诞树的成功放置全要归功于他。</span>
<code>What happened later is that the guerrillas who came out</code>
<span>后来，那些在圣诞树亮灯期间</span>
<code>during the Christmas tree  operation and all of that</code>
<span>逃出来的游击队员说：</span>
<code>said, "That's really good, Christmas trees are really cool,</code>
<span>“太好了，那些圣诞树很酷，</span>
<code>but you know what? We really don't walk anymore.</code>
<span>不过你们知道吗？我们已经不再在陆地上走动了，</span>
<code>We use rivers."</code>
<span>我们转移到河上行动了。”</span>
<code>So rivers are the highways of the jungle,</code>
<span>河流就像丛林中的高速路，</span>
<code>and this is something we learned,</code>
<span>我们了解到了这点，</span>
<code>and most of the recruiting was being done in and around the river villages.</code>
<span>而且大多数的招募工作，都是在河边的村庄一带进行的。</span>
<code>So we went to these river villages,</code>
<span>于是我们深入那些河边的村庄，</span>
<code>and we asked the people,</code>
<span>对村民进行询问，</span>
<code>and probably some of them were direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.</code>
<span>他们中的一些人很可能就认识那些游击队员。</span>
<code>We asked them, "Can you send guerrillas a message?"</code>
<span>我们问道： “你们有什么话要捎给游击队员吗？”</span>
<code>We collected over 6,000 messages.</code>
<span>我们搜集到六千多条讯息，</span>
<code>Some of them were notes saying, get out.</code>
<span>一些是写着“出来吧”等字样的纸条，</span>
<code>Some of them were toys. Some of them were candy.</code>
<span>一些是玩具，一些是糖果，</span>
<code>Even people took off their jewelry, their little crosses and religious things,</code>
<span>有些人甚至摘下身上的首饰、十字架和别的一些宗教饰品，</span>
<code>and put them in these floating balls that we sent down the rivers</code>
<span>安置在我们在河面上播撒的 这些漂浮球里，</span>
<code>so that they could be picked up at night.</code>
<span>在夜晚就可以被捞起。</span>
<code>And we sent thousands of these down the rivers,</code>
<span>我们在河中放出了几千个这样的漂浮球，</span>
<code>and then picked them up later if they weren't.</code>
<span>过后回收那些没被捡走的。</span>
<code>But lots of them were picked up.</code>
<span>大量的漂浮球都被捡走了。</span>
<code>This generated, on average, a demobilization every six hours,</code>
<span>这项举措平均每六小时能“劝”回一个游击队员，</span>
<code>so this was incredible and it was about: Come home at Christmas.</code>
<span>效果惊人。这里的核心讯息就是：在圣诞回家。</span>
<code>Then came the peace process,</code>
<span>然后和谈进程启动，</span>
<code>and when the peace process started,</code>
<span>一旦和谈进程启动，</span>
<code>the whole mindset of the guerrilla changed.</code>
<span>整个游击队的心态都发生了改变。</span>
<code>And it changed because</code>
<span>这种改变的原因在于</span>
<code>it makes you think, "Well, if there's a peace process,</code>
<span>它让你思考：“如果和谈开始，</span>
<code>this is probably going to be over.</code>
<span>战乱就可能会终结。</span>
<code>At some point I'm going to get out."</code>
<span>在某个时刻我就能摆脱这里了。”</span>
<code>And their fears completely changed,</code>
<span>他们的恐惧完全改观了，</span>
<code>and their fears were not about, "Am I going to get killed?"</code>
<span>他们不再害怕“我是不是要被杀了？”</span>
<code>Their fears were, "Am I going to be rejected?</code>
<span>他们的恐惧变成了“我会不会被拒绝？</span>
<code>When I get out of this, am I going to be rejected?"</code>
<span>如果我想回归社会，会不会被拒绝？“</span>
<code>So the past Christmas,  what we did was we asked --</code>
<span>于是去年圣诞节，</span>
<code>we found 27 mothers of guerrillas,</code>
<span>我们找到了27名游击队员的母亲，</span>
<code>and we asked them to give us  pictures of their children,</code>
<span>请求她们把子女小时候的照片给我们，</span>
<code>when they only could recognize themselves, so as not to put their lives in danger,</code>
<span>因为只有游击队员自己能认出这些照片，所以他们的性命应该没有危险，</span>
<code>and we asked them to give the most motherly message you can get,</code>
<span>我们还请求她们做出最具母性的表态，</span>
<code>which is, "Before you were a guerrilla, you were my child,</code>
<span>那就是，“就算你是游击队员，你首先是我的孩子，</span>
<code>so come home, I'm waiting for you."</code>
<span>回家吧，我在等你。”</span>
<code>You can see the pictures here. I'll show you a couple.</code>
<span>我给你们看看其中的一些照片。</span>
<code>(Applause)</code>
<span>（掌声）</span>
<code>Thank you.</code>
<span>谢谢。</span>
<code>And these pictures were placed in many different places,</code>
<span>这些照片被张贴在各种不同的地点，</span>
<code>and a lot of them came back,</code>
<span>很多游击队员因此退出了，</span>
<code>and it was really, really beautiful.</code>
<span>那副景象实在是美不胜收。</span>
<code>And then we decided to work with society.</code>
<span>我们随后决定与社区合作。</span>
<code>So we did mothers around Christmastime.</code>
<span>在圣诞期间做了母亲留言的活动。</span>
<code>Now let's talk about the rest of the people.</code>
<span>现在，让我们来看看其他人。</span>
<code>And you may be aware of this or not, but there was a World Cup this year,</code>
<span>你们也许知道，今年有世界杯，</span>
<code>and Colombia played really well, and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.</code>
<span>哥伦比亚的成绩非常出色，这正是团结哥伦比亚的绝好时机。</span>
<code>And what we did was tell the guerrillas,</code>
<span>我们向游击队员提出：</span>
<code>"Come, get out of the jungle. We're saving a place for you."</code>
<span>“回来吧，从丛林里出来，我们为你留着位子。”</span>
<code>So this was television, this was  all different types of media saying,</code>
<span>这个活动是通过电视和其他各种媒体渠道来表达</span>
<code>"We are saving a place for you."</code>
<span>“我们为你留着位子”。</span>
<code>The soldier here in the commercial says,</code>
<span>这个广告里的军人在说，</span>
<code>"I'm saving a place for you right here in this helicopter</code>
<span>“就在这架直升机上，我为你留着位子，</span>
<code>so that you can get out of this jungle and go enjoy the World Cup."</code>
<span>从丛林走出来去享受世界杯吧。“</span>
<code>Ex-football players, radio announcers,</code>
<span>前足球运动员、电台主播，</span>
<code>everybody was saving a place for the guerrilla.</code>
<span>所有人都为游击队员留出了一席之地。</span>
<code>So since we started this work a little over eight years ago,</code>
<span>从八年多以前，我们开始介入说服游击队员的工作以来，</span>
<code>17,000 guerrillas have demobilized.</code>
<span>已有一万七千多人主动退出了游击队。</span>
<code>I do not -- (Applause)</code>
<span>我并不——（鼓掌）</span>
<code>Thank you.</code>
<span>哦，谢谢。</span>
<code>I don't want to say in any way that it only has to do with what we do,</code>
<span>我不想说这项成果都要归功于我们的工作，</span>
<code>but what I do know is that our work and the work that we do</code>
